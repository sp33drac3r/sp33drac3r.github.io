	  <h1>Managing Change</h1>
    <h4>Debunking Planned Obsolescence</h4>
    <h5>March 6, 2016</h5>
	    <p> Hardware products break all the time. They have thousands of tiny fragile parts and glass-covered screens. Sometimes they’ll unexpectedly shut down and never turn on again. Standards change - usb-c device don’t take usb plugs and usb outlets don’t output as much power as a usb-c quick charge port needs to charge quickly. It’s cheaper to replace a tablet than it is to repair it. Magical devices worth hundreds of dollars and hours waiting in line expire more quickly than many of the edible items in your pantry. It’s no wonder consumers see some conspiracy in this phenomenon, claiming these short-shelf-life devices are the result of planned obsolescence. The idea behind planned obsolescence is that a product’s lifespan is artificially limited. This can happen in a number of ways but the two most common forms of planned obsolescence are breakage with regular use, software advances so rapidly, that the hardware requirements also change, necessitating bigger processors or new charging cables for instance. Most people think planned obsolescence a conspiracy, a way for big tech companies insure future revenue and there are historical examples of companies engaging in this sort of market rigging, the 1,000 hour GE light bulb for example. I can’t claim that there are not machiavellian MBA types insuring their bottom line with limited-life products but I can say that there are very real technical and cultural reasons why devices stop working after only a few years having nothing to do with planned obsolescence.</p>
	    
	    <p>I know this because I worked at a large, colorful tech company on a product that was the first to market in a completely new technology space. Furthermore, I worked on customer support for this product so I got very well acquainted with all common failure points and user issues. It was my job to analyze data from hundreds of thousands for phone conversations, emails, reports and product reviews, synthesize that information and help the product and engineering understand and fix the seemingly endless supply of problems. You might think the most difficult part of my job was wading through this mountain of bad data to produce actionable insights but it wasn’t. The biggest challenge I faced was convincing product and engineering that there were problems worth fixing.</p>
	    
	    <p>To understand the technical and cultural reasons behind the short lifespan of many of these new devices, it will help to understand the launch cycle of a product that does well in the market.</p>
	    
	    <p>Many months, if not years, of preparation come before a product is launched. Once it finally launches, the team will care about how well it’s doing… for about a month. In a month they can tell if it’s not doing well and they need to shut it down or, if it’s doing well, they have a much much more difficult problem, what to do next. Engineers will start to sprint again working on all of the features that should have made it into the first release but didn’t. This leaves very little resources to fix bugs or attend to the initial feedback from customers. It’s likely at this point, that your product is still single sourced. Meaning that the manufacturer, either your own company or a third party manufacturer is acquiring all of the different pieces that make up the bill of materials from one source. To ensure product delivery, supply chain people will now start to work on getting multiple sources for the bill of materials, which brings variation into your product’s hardware components.</p>
	    
	    <p>If you have a successful product, you can bet that competition isn’t far behind and, if they can, they’ll start putting together a similar product with more expensive hardware so it can support more impressive features. They will then sell this product at a competitive price-point, perhaps even taking a loss overall, just so they can gain market share in this exciting new space. Now you have that to compete with. This means designing software to try to stay ahead of new competitors and shift your attention to version 2 of the product which will be even faster and better than the old one. </p>
	    
	    <p>This focus on new features, heavier software to support more expensive operations, variation in hardware components and a lack of interest in user bugs or any user operability issues that doesn’t affect 100% of the userbase contribute to product failures for users. This usually happens with new releases of either hardware versions or software updates and it is frequently the case that any change to the product will cause the product to become obsolete for a certain subset of users.</p>
	    
	    <p>Tech companies put insane, unrealistic goals on their products. It’s part of the culture. Your doodad doesn’t matter one iota unless it has 10 million users and even then, it’s considered cute until it hits the 100 million user mark. With these goals in mind, it is difficult to convince the top brass that an issue affecting 10,000 users is worth worrying about. </p>
	    
	    <p>But it is worth worrying about. It’s worth losing sleep over. Those 10,000 users are your early adopters, they were your biggest fans and they want to like your product. That’s why they took a gamble on getting version 1. If they feel spurned, they won’t keep quiet and they will impact your chances of having a brand that’s worth anything when the competition catches up.</p>

	    <p>The fact that your new widget goes belly after a year or two really has very little to do with some grand plan to get dip into the consumer's wallets again and again. Never explain with conspiracy what can be explained with negligence. With consumer tech products, it’s a little bit of negligence and a lota bit of a rapidly changing technical landscape with fierce competition that causes these failures.</p>
	    
	    <p>This problem is so endemic to the speed-driven culture, the realities of technology change, hardware limitation and multi-sourcing that there is no way to make it go away for good. If you are working in a space where change is rapid and people will want a new one of whatever you’re selling in two years anyway, great, you don’t need to spend much time thinking about this. Phones are a good example of products that are expected to fail after about two years. This isn’t such a problem for consumers because after to years, people’s tastes in phones have usually changed so the consumer actually wants to purchase a new phone by the time it’s life cycle is over. People want a new phone about every two years anyway and they are low cost enough that people are willing to reinvest. Where it becomes tricky is with products that have a longer buy cycle. People purchase a new laptop every 4 to 6 years so if you have a hardware spec that can’t keep up with your software releases that allow you to stay competitive in the marketplace, then you’re going to have a bad time. A TV is probably the worst case scenario for technical obsolescence because they are expensive, big ticket items and people only buy new ones every 6 to 8 years. Not only that, but the competition is so intense between TV manufacturers sell TVs almost at cost so they try to get the bill of materials down as low as possible, which means using older, inexpensive technologies.</p>
	    
	    <p>The best case scenario for both the consumer and manufacturer is to create a market with a strong following and people who can’t wait for the latest and greatest product from your company. This will create a market with style obsolescence, where consumers are clamboring to get the new device even though the old one continues to function perfectly. This kind of market atmosphere can only be achieved by carefully attending to fixing bugs as the crop up and minimizing their impact with staged releases and statistically significant test samples for all hardware and software changes. From an organizational standpoint, there should be an understanding that any features that are limited to a certain subset of the existing users base, due to hardware specifications can be deemed too risky for release and if you must release something that is not backwards compatible with older models, do some marketing work to make sure that there is a slightly different brand attached to the new versions so consumers are not confused. </p>
