    <h4>CSS Positioning</h4>
    <h5>Feb 29, 2016</h5>
	  <p>So, you’ve been given some wireframes and it’s your job to markup an HTML skeleton and style it with CSS. One of the main workhorses for this task will be the position attribute along with top, right, bottom, left attributes (represented as %, px or em). CSS is fun and easy to play around with so, if you like to dabble, stop reading now and try out all four position attributes to see how they work.</p>
	  <ul>
	  	<li>position: static;</li>
	  	<li>position: relative;</li>
	  	<li>position: fixed;</li>
	  	<li>position: absolute;
	  </ul>
	  <p>It is important to have a foundational understanding of these four position states because sloppily chosen CSS position may look alright when you’re doing mock up but as soon as you change your window size, random elements could become misaligned. Luckily, there are only 4 different types of positioning available so becoming a positioning expert is no challenge. These four, combined with other CSS elements will be everything you need to get your blocks positioned correctly on the page.</p>
	  <p>Positions are best understood with working code - we’ll be using the HTML below to move our boxes around to where we want them.</p>
	  <pre><code>
		  &lt;div id="box-1">Box 1&lt;/div>
		  &lt;div id="box-2">Box 2&lt;/div>
		  &lt;div id="box-3">Box 3&lt;/div>
		  &lt;div id="box-4">Box 4&lt;/div>
	  </code></pre>
	  <p><strong>Static:</strong> A statically positioned element is the default positioning. CSS takes no credit for the positioning of a static element. The element will flow on the page as if it were styled by the the browser reading pure HTML - in order the elements appear in the document flow. Properties that work on other positions like top, left, up, right and z-index do you apply for a statically positioned elements. Well-placed statically positioned elements are a beautiful thing, but they’re no fun. Let’s move on to the fun positions.</p>
		  <code>
		  	#box-1 {
		  background-color: purple;
		  position: static;
		  width: 200px;
		  height: 100px;
		}
		#box-2 {
		  background-color: red;
		  position: static;
		  width: 200px;
		  height: 100px;
		}
		#box-3 {
		  background-color: green;
		  position: static;
		  width: 200px;
		  height: 100px;
		}
		#box-4 {
		  background-color: navy;
		  position: static;
		  width: 200px;
		  height: 100px;
		}
		  </code>

	  <p><strong>Fixed:</strong> Elements that do not move relative to the window are fixed elements. Elements with position: fixed;  are great for headers, footers, navbars of any element to which users should have ready access. These elements will remain stable on the page. Depending on the z-index of these elements and the other elements on the page, moving elements on the page can overlap or underlap fixed elements. According to opinionated internet people, fixed position elements are falling out of favor as a design principle in favor of elements that change dynamically upon scroll. I think they’re still quite useful.</p>
	  <code>
	  	#box-1 {
		  background-color: purple;
		  position: fixed;
		  width: 100%;
		  height: 100px;
		  top: 0;
		}
		#box-2 {
		  background-color: red;
		  position: static;
		  width: 200px;
		  height: 100px;
		}
		#box-3 {
		  background-color: green;
		  position: static;
		  width: 200px;
		  height: 100px;
		}
		#box-4 {
		  background-color: navy;
		  position: fixed;
		  width: 100%;
		  height: 100px;
		  bottom: 0;
		}
	  </code>

	  <p><strong>Relative:</strong> Repeat after me, “a relatively positioned element is positioned relative to itself.” That is to say, it is positioned relative to the position it would have had if it were position: static;. Put yet another way, if you relatively position an element and you set the top, left, right, or bottom attributes to 0, your element will essentially be statically positioned.
	  <br>Note: One important design pattern is to use position: absolute; elements (see below) that are within the scope of position: relative; elements. Another interesting possibility with relatively positioned elements is that it opens up the potential to use the z-index attribute to bring height or depth to the element.</p>
	  <code>
	    	#box-1 {
		  background-color: purple;
		  position: fixed;
		  width: 100%;
		  height: 100px;
		  top: 0;
		}
		#box-2 {
		  background-color: red;
		  position: relative;
		  width: 200px;
		  height: 100px;
		  top: 100px;
		  left: 20%;
		}
		#box-3 {
		  background-color: green;
		  position: relative;
		  width: 200px;
		  height: 100px;
		  top: 0;
		  left: 40%;

		}
		#box-4 {
		  background-color: navy;
		  position: fixed;
		  width: 100%;
		  height: 100px;
		  bottom: 0;
	  </code>

	  <p><strong>Absolute:</strong> This one is super handy. For this last example, we'll modify the HTML a little bit so that the Box 3 div is inside the Box 2 div. It is similar to relative positioning in that the element is defined relatively, but rather than being positioned relative to itself, it is positioned relative to its first parent element that is either position: relative; or position: absolute. If there is no parent element that meets this criteria, the element will be positioned relative to the page itself. Though absolutely positioning is very useful, as a site grows in size and complexity, an over-abundance of absolutely positioned elements can make it cumbersome to make future changes.</p>
	  <code>
			 &lt;div id="box-1">Box 1&lt;/div>
		  &lt;div id="box-2">Box 2
		  	&lt;div id="box-3">Box 3&lt;/div>
		  &lt;/div>
      &lt;div id="box-4">Box 4&lt;/div>
	  </code>
	  <code>
	  #box-1 {
		  background-color: purple;
		  position: fixed;
		  width: 100%;
		  height: 100px;
		  top: 0;
		}
		#box-2 {
		  background-color: red;
		  position: relative;
		  width: 400px;
		  height: 400px;
		  top: 100px;
		  left: 20%;
		}
		#box-3 {
		  background-color: green;
		  position: absolute;
		  width: 100px;
		  height: 100px;
		  top: 50%;
		  left: 50%;

		}
		#box-4 {
		  background-color: navy;
		  position: fixed;
		  width: 100%;
		  height: 100px;
		  bottom: 0;
		}
	  </code>

	  <p>That’s it! That’s all you need to know about positioning blocks with CSS. Go forth and position with confidence.</p>
