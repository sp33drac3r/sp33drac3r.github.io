Q: How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
A: Difficult. It's challenging to describe where boxes should be. You have to come up with a language that both people can understand so instead of saying things like "no that box right there" you should say "the nav box" or "the footer box" and then describe the position you want relative to other elements on the page. Once we started to get that shared language going, the wireframing process sped up a lot. At the end of the exercise, we were both surprised at how simple the wireframe looked compared to how much effort it had taken to get it done.

Q: Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
A: Yes, I really like to play around with the wireframes a lot and it would be frustrating to wait until after I had coded everything up to find out that I actually want something completely different. I really like the idea of coming up with different layouts and discussing the benefits and drawbacks with stakeholders. It's fun to be deliberate about design and really think about where each element should go on the page and why.

Q: What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
A: We used balsamiq because that's what she was familiar with. I prefer to use Google Slides. The end result was similar. We went for the simple boxes with a little bit of filler text approach. I know it's unorthodox but I really like adding color to wireframes once layout is done. Google Slides makes it SO easy to add any hex value you want. I really can't say enough about how much I like using Google Slides to wireframe.

Q: What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)? 
A: We learned about <nav>, <header> and <footer>-->
