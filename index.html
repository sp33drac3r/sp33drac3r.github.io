	  <h1>I'm Riley: a software developer with ops experience</h1>
		<p>Working in tech and coming from a bachelor's in political science has meant wearing many different hats. My first hat was as co-founder and business development director of a little education technology company called LangaugeTwin that allowed university students who were trying to learn each otherâ€™s language to have a conversation. My second hat was on support at YouTube but quickly morphed into business analysis working on a secret new project that would become Chromecast. My next hat is web development - a hat-trick.</p>
		<p><strong>Google:</strong> I worked for 3 years as chromecast user support lead business analyst where I did forecasting and demand planning for phone support, PO management, dashboarding, and was the voice of the user, surfacing issues and user reports to product and engineering.</p>
		<p><strong>LanguageTwin:</strong> At LanguageTwin, I was responsible for overseeing web application redesign and test, getting investors for our seed round, marketing outreach and onboarding to our beta test pilot program bringing on some of the best language universities worldwide.</p>
